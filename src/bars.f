C The length (L) of a bar of metal at temperature T째C
C is given by the equation
C L=L0+E*T*L0
C where L0 is the length at 0째C and E is the coefficient of expansion
C program produce a set of tables showing the lengths of 10 bars
C at various temperatures if each is exactly 1m long at 20째C
C reading 10 sets of data (one for each bar) consisting of
C the coefficient of expansion and the range of temperatures
